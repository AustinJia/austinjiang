	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p> Greetings, and welcome to my webpage. My name is Hua(Austin) Jiang.  I graduated with Mechanical Engineering bachelor degree(Fall 2016)
		and Computer Science (Fall 2018) in Goergia Tech. Passionate about the robotics, and the move to robotics filed will be nautral fit for
		in the future. </p>
	<h2>Current Interests</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Robotics Learning</li>
		<li>Robotics RL combined with simulation-to-real transfer</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Future Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Get a PhD in Robotics.</li>
		<li>Become a research professor after PhD.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<ul>

	<!-- <h2>Bio</h2>

	<p>Be honor of a student, Be honor of a researcher, Be honor of a future scientist.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Austin Jiang</b> moved to Atlanta from Ames, IA. Before move to Georgia Tech (2014), 
		He studied mechanical engineering at the Iowa State University (2012) and also took
		summer school in UC, Berkeley (Summer 2012) and study abroad in Hong Kong University
		of Science and Technology (Spring 2014). After got his bachelor degree in Georgia Tech
		(Fall 2016), unsatisfied with the exclusive knowledge only in mechanical engineering.
		He decided to take second bachelor degree in computer science, in order to explore the
		computer vision and controlling of robotics. Proceeded to work in a fast,
		upscale academic environment, assuring understanding the new course knowledge
		in a thorough way.  Passionate about the robotics, the move to robotic filed will
		be a natural fit for me in the future.  With encouragement from friends and Professors,
		Austin planned apply for PhD in robotics in 2018.  In his free time, Austin loves to go
		hiking with his labmates.  He also loves biking and promoting ride bike culture.
		Austin also volunteers every Friday afternnon in GT Starter Bikes club to
		help student to fix their bikes.

	<h4>Quota</h4>
	<p>
		Universities are places where facts made. Research is a long term
		process, so a curious heart can always find a unique approach the
		current problem, and a pure and focused heart can strive to solve
		the tough problem. With the windows of research, I find myself
		think problegit ms in a more critically, accepting fewer assertions
		at face value and developing an emboldened sense of what I can
		accomplish. Therefore, stay in university, stay in academic,
		and stay with facts forever.
