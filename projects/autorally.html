        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>I was in charge of upgrading the bought car models to match the design required  by uninstalling the gasoline tank section and installing a custom made battery section making the car significantly more energy efficient.</p>

        <h1>Software Work</h1>
        <p>I decided to dive deeper into the topics of autonomous vehicles by researching under Dr.James Rehg’s AutoRally project, initiating the Python/C++ codebase for the lane detection component, which is based on the real-time images captured by AutoRally’s built-in camera.</p>

        3. The video is the primary result what I analyze from the real-time image captured by AutoRally's Built in camera
        in the video, there are three sections
        <ol>
          <li>upper section is the original image</li>
          <li>the middle section is the processing image</li>
          <li>the lower section is the processed image using chan-vase algorithm.</li>
        </ol>
        	-still not incorporated into the project, but Austin developed the first steps to work towards making it useful.</p>

        <h1>Potentially useful information</h1>
        <p>Future work:
        Using machine learning algorithm to mark the lane based on large amount of the images, then separate the lane.

        -raw data -> manipulate to make data readable for the ML -> train AI to AI -> AI learns.
        -added manual data so that the AI could learn first before it does its thing on its own.




        To do list and random notes.:

        Add text to radio-boxv2 naming the
        -calliper instrument usage.
        -do in radio-box-v4 the same thing you did in v2 and then delete v2.

        Mechanical build: updated bought cars to match the latest design by removing the gasoline section and installing the battery section.

        Mechanical Design:
          1. using Inventor to redesign Radio Box GPS box to hold Arduino, KillSwitch and RC_Receiver.[Since the Rally car select a bigger size of battery, which made us has too redesign the radio box.]
          2. Using Inventor to redesign the electronic box to secure allow Arduino Due and USB breakout board.
        -get picture of it.
