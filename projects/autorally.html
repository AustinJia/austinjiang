      <h1>Mechanical Work</h1>
      <p>Mechanical build: updated bought cars to match the latest design by removing the gasoline section and installing the battery section.</p>

      <p>Mechanical Design:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>using Inventor to redesign Radio Box GPS box to hold Arduino, KillSwitch and RC_Receiver.[Since the Rally car select a bigger size of battery, which made us has too redesign the radio box.]</li>
        <li>Using Inventor to redesign the electronic box to secure allow Arduino Due and USB breakout board.</li>
      </ol>
      -get picture of it.</p>
      <p> the position of Radio Box in the whole car</p>

      <p> Since the increase length of battery, which made the radio box has to be smaller</p>

      <h1>Software Work</h1>
      <p>I decided to dive deeper into the topics of autonomous vehicles by researching under Dr.James Rehg’s AutoRally project, initiating the Python/C++ codebase for the lane detection component, which is based on the real-time images captured by AutoRally’s built-in camera.</p>

      3. The video is the primary result what I analyze from the real-time image captured by AutoRally's Built in camera
      in the video, there are three sections
      <ol>
        <li>upper section is the original image</li>
        <li>the middle section is the processing image</li>
        <li>the lower section is the processed image using chan-vase algorithm.</li>
      </ol>
      	-still not incorporated into the project, but Austin developed the first steps to work towards making it useful.</p>

      <h1>Potentially useful information</h1>
      <p>Future work:
      Using machine learning algorithm to mark the lane based on large amount of the images, then separate the lane.

      -raw data -> manipulate to make data readable for the ML -> train AI to AI -> AI learns.
      -added manual data so that the AI could learn first before it does its thing on its own.




      To do list and random notes.:

      Add text to radio-boxv2 naming the
      -calliper instrument usage.
      -do in radio-box-v4 the same thing you did in v2 and then delete v2.

      Mechanical Design:
        1. using Inventor to redesign Radio Box GPS box to hold Arduino, KillSwitch and RC_Receiver.[Since the Rally car select a bigger size of battery, which made us has too redesign the radio box.]
        2. Using Inventor to redesign the electronic box to secure allow Arduino Due and USB breakout board.

      3. The video(AutoRally_ComputerVision, https://youtu.be/VZUxi6FWKKY) is the primary result what I analyze from the real-time image captured by AutoRally's Built in camera
      in the video, there are three sectition
        1. upper section is the original image
        2. the middle section is the processing image
        3. the lower section is the processed image using chan-vase algorithm.
