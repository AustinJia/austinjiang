					<b>Austin Jiang</b> moved to Atlanta from Ames, IA. Before move to Georgia Tech (2014), 
					He studied mechanical engineering at the Iowa State University (2012) and also took
					summer school in UC, Berkeley (Summer 2012) and study abroad in Hong Kong University
					of Science and Technology (Spring 2014). After got his bachelor degree in Georgia Tech
					(Fall 2016), unsatisfied with the exclusive knowledge only in mechanical engineering.
					He decided to take second bachelor degree in computer science, in order to explore the
					computer vision and controlling of robotics. Proceeded to work in a fast,
					upscale academic environment, assuring understanding the new course knowledge
					in a thorough way.  Passionate about the robotics, the move to robotic filed will
					be a natural fit for me in the future.  With encouragement from friends and Professors,
					Austin planned apply for PhD in robotics in 2018.  In his free time, Austin loves to go
					hiking with his labmates.  He also loves biking and promoting ride bike culture.
					Austin also volunteers every Friday afternnon in GT Starter Bikes club to
					help student to fix their bikes.

					Universities are places where facts made. Research is a long term
					process, so a curious heart can always find a unique approach the
					current problem, and a pure and focused heart can strive to solve
					the tough problem. With the windows of research, I find myself
					think problegit ms in a more critically, accepting fewer assertions
					at face value and developing an emboldened sense of what I can
					accomplish. Therefore, stay in university, stay in academic,
					and stay with facts forever.</li>
