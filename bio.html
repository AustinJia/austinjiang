							<p class="first">
								Universities are places where facts made. Research is a long term process, so a curious,
								heart can always find a unique approach the current problem, and a pure and focused
								heart can strive to solve the tough problem. With the windows of research, I find
								myself think problegit ms in a more critically, accepting fewer assertions at face value
								and developing an emboldened sense of what I can accomplish. Therefore, stay in
								university, stay in academic, and stay with facts forever.

								Austin Jiang moved to Atlanta from Ames, IA. Before move to Georgia Tech (2014), 
								He studied mechanical engineering at the Iowa State University (2012) and also took
								summer school in UC, Berkeley (Summer 2012) and study abroad in Hong Kong University
								of Science and Technology (Spring 2014). After got his bachelor degree in Georgia Tech
								(Fall 2016), unsatisfied with the exclusive knowledge only in mechanical engineering.
								He decided to take second bachelor degree in computer science, in order to explore the
								computer vision and controlling of robotics. Proceeded to work in a fast,
								upscale academic environment, assuring understanding the new course knowledge
								in a thorough way.  Passionate about the robotics, the move to robotic filed will
								be a natural fit for me in the future.  With encouragement from friends and Professors,
								Austin planned apply for PhD in robotics in 2018.  In his free time, Austin loves to go
								hiking with his labmates.  He also runs a local musicians studio, and loves biking and
								promoting ride bike culture. Austin also volunteers every Friday afternnon
								in GT Starter Bikes club to help student to fix their bikes.
